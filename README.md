Hello, this repository contains the python notebook ANA500 Micro-Project which will complete all the steps of the data science process of Acquire, Prepare, Analyze Data, Report,and Act for the dataset heart disease.csv provided by the ANA500 professor. This project will use many different libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to organize, clean, analyze, and provide visualizations for the dataset used. machine learning regression and deep learning regression techniques will also be used to model the data. The first part of the project loads the dataset and performs EDA to get a sense of the data. The second part focuses on visualizations that can be used to help understand the relationships between the variables. The third part will use machine learning regression techniques like linear and SVM regression. The fourth and final part will use deep learning regression techniques such as recurrent neural networks. Please let me know if you have any questions or whether I can clarify anything about this project. Thanks!
